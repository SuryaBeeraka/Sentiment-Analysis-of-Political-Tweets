📌 GitHub README for Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets

Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets 🗳️📊

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze sentiment trends in tweets related to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing insights into public opinion on political figures.

📌 Project Overview

This study utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and multiple classification models to analyze political sentiment on Twitter. The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, and models were evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to ensure robust sentiment classification.

🔹 Key Features
	•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed noise, tokenized text, normalized case, and applied lemmatization.
	•	Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization to represent tweets numerically.
	•	Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an Ensemble Model.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Used confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.
	•	Cross-validation: Performed 5-fold cross-validation to improve model generalization.
	•	Visualization: Graphical representation of sentiment trends using matplotlib & seaborn.

📌 Technologies & Tools Used

✔ Programming Languages: Python
✔ Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK
✔ Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
✔ Text Processing: TF-IDF Vectorization, Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization

📌 Dataset & Preprocessing
	•	Dataset: Tweets related to Barack Obama & Mitt Romney collected from Twitter.
	•	Preprocessing Steps:
🔹 Removed URLs, special characters, and numbers to clean raw text.
🔹 Standardized text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
🔹 Tokenization & Stopword Removal to extract meaningful words.
🔹 Lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms.
🔹 Feature Engineering: Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to transform text into numerical representations.

📌 Model Selection & Evaluation

Different models were tested to identify the best approach for sentiment classification:

Model	Accuracy	Observations
Logistic Regression	59.54%	Simple & effective for binary classification.
Random Forest	54.97%	Struggled due to sparse text data.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	58.54%	Required fine-tuning but performed moderately well.
Neural Networks (LSTM)	55.7%	Captured long-term dependencies but required more data.
Ensemble Model (Logistic Regression + Random Forest)	61.68%	Best-performing model, combining simplicity & complexity.

📌 Key Findings & Lessons Learned

✔ Data preprocessing significantly impacts model performance.
✔ Combining multiple models (ensemble learning) improves accuracy.
✔ 5-fold cross-validation helps in model generalization.
✔ Feature engineering, such as TF-IDF, is crucial for text classification tasks.
✔ Understanding model limitations helps in selecting the right approach for sentiment analysis.
